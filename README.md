#Temperature Converter Lab

In this lab we will be writing javascript to make a temperature conversion utility.

##Requirements
Create a single page using bootstrap that contains an `<input>` field, a `<button>` and a `<div>`. Convert the temperature from F to C using the formula we created earlier this week.

1. User puts in a value into the text field
2. User clicks on button
3. `div` gets updated with converted value.
4. Make a clear button to reset the fields

Use your existing temperature converting code you constructed earlier this week.

**Bonus**
1. Have the `div` be `blue` for freezing, `red2`  for above freezing.
2. Use a `dropdown` or `radio` button to select different units to convert.

##Part 2
Finish up Mockup 2 and 3 in Bootstrap.
